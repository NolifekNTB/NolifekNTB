# 💫 About Me:
I’m a passionate Android Developer specializing in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. My experience includes building modern Android apps using MVVM, Coroutines, and other Android Jetpack libraries.

My journey with Android started when I was 13, when I rooted my first phone, unlocked the first bootloader, and installed a custom ROM. Five years later, I began creating Android applications using Kotlin. I've gained a lot of experience by creating many Android apps with Kotlin. Every project has taught me something new.
